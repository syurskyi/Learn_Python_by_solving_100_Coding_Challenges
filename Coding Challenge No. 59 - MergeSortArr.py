# Merge Sorted Array
# Question: Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.
# Note: You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.
# Solutions:


class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, A, m, B, n):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :type m: int
        :type B: List[int]
        :type n: int

        indexA = m-1;

# All you need is understanding the algorithm, don't try other cases.
# In case you're wondering, if the requirements do not include modifying an array in-place. This is how you merge arrays:

arr1 = [1,2,3,10,20]
arr2 = [2,2,10,60]
result = sorted(arr1 + arr2)
print ( result )
