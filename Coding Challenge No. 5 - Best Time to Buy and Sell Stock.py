# Solutions:

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(prices):
        minValue = float("inf")
        maxBenefit = 0
        for price in prices:
            if minValue > price:
                minValue = price
            if maxBenefit < price - minValue:
                maxBenefit = price - minValue
        return maxBenefit

print (Solution.maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]) )
print (Solution.maxProfit([7, 6, 4, 3, 1]) )
