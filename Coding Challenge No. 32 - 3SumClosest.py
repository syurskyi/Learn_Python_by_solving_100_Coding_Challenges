# 3 Sum Closest
# Question: Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number,
# target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution
# For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1. The sum that is closest to the target is 2.
# (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
# Solutions:
